DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP — Step-by-Step
Each phase adds one or two new systems. I’ll note dependencies and provide notes if anything can be built in parallel.

PHASE 1: Core Loop Prototype
Focus: Establish gameplay flow with placeholder data.

Features to Build:

main.py game loop

Script generator (scripts.py)

Talent/actor generator (actors.py)

Movie production simulation (studio.py)

Goals:

Run a basic loop that generates a script, picks an actor, combines into a movie, and prints a result.

PHASE 2: Expand Production System
Add deeper logic to movies and simulation outputs.

New Systems:

Movie quality based on cast compatibility, budget, and genre

Random production events (delays, on-set problems)

Fame/reputation of studio

Goals:

Simulate different outcomes with repeatable logic

Provide meaningful trade-offs

PHASE 3: Time & Release System
Introduce weeks or months to simulate a full year.

New Systems:

Game calendar system (e.g., 12-month loop)

Release windows and market competition

Box office result calculation (using genre popularity)

Goals:

Schedule movie releases

Compete against AI/random rival releases

PHASE 4: Studio Management
Introduce financial pressure and strategic planning.

New Systems:

Bank account / cash balance

Movie costs vs. earnings

Hiring additional staff (producers, marketers)

Monthly reports

Goals:

Track profits/losses

Make success sustainable

PHASE 5: Polishing + Random Events
Add narrative depth and replayability.

New Systems:

Scandals, talent burnout, rival sabotage

Genre trend shifts over time

Awards season (bonus prestige)

Goals:

Add flavour and unpredictability

Introduce risk/reward situations

BONUS PHASE: GUI / Visualization
Optional — add a minimal visual interface later.

Options:

Use tkinter or PyQt for desktop UI

Use textual or rich for advanced terminal views (like tables, charts)

Or create a web-based UI using Flask or Remi
