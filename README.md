# 🎬 HollywoodSim

A minimalist, turn-based Hollywood studio simulator built in Python.  
Inspired by classics like *The Movies*, *Hollywood Mogul*, and *Total Extreme Wrestling*, it focuses on strategic planning, actor selection, movie production, and box office success — all with a clean, text-based interface.
