1.0 Core Vision & Philosophy
HollywoodSim is a minimalist, turn-based Hollywood studio simulator. Inspired by classics like The Movies, Hollywood Mogul, and Total Extreme Wrestling, it emphasizes strategic decision-making over graphical fidelity.

Minimal Graphics, Maximum Replayability: The focus is on deep, interlocking systems that create emergent narratives and strategic challenges.

Text-Driven Clarity: Information is presented clearly and concisely, allowing players to make informed decisions without visual clutter.

Evolving Systems: The simulation should feel alive, with market trends, actor careers, and studio reputations changing organically over time.

Meaningful Choices: No action should feel wasted. Every decision—from script rewrites to release timing—should have a tangible impact on the studio's trajectory.

2.0 The Core Gameplay Loop
The game progresses in monthly turns. Each turn, the player engages in a strategic cycle designed to grow their studio from a small upstart to an industry titan.

Briefing Phase: Review the current market forecast, genre trends, studio finances, and any news or events.

Acquisition Phase: Choose from a selection of script pitches and hire key talent (actors, directors, etc.) from an available pool.

Development & Scheduling Phase: Assign talent to scripts. Invest in rewrites, marketing campaigns, or other improvements. Slot finished films into the future release calendar.

Release & Resolution Phase: Films scheduled for the current month are released. Box office earnings, critical reviews, and audience scores are calculated.

Reporting Phase: Pay monthly operating expenses. Receive a summary of the month's performance, watching your studio's cash, prestige, and reputation change in response to your decisions.

3.0 Primary Systems (Detailed Breakdown)
3.1 Script Generation & Development
Scripts are the lifeblood of the studio. The system allows for both procedural generation and deep player customization.

Script Attributes:

genre(s): Primary and optional secondary genre (e.g., ["Action", "Comedy"]).

themes: Descriptive tags like "Revenge," "Family," or "Political Intrigue."

initial_appeal: A base score indicating market potential.

complexity: A 1-5 scale affecting cost, development time, and potential critic_score.

budget_class: Low, Indie, Mid-Budget, or Blockbuster.

style_sliders: Toggles for Tone (Lighthearted ↔ Dark) and Pacing (Slow Burn ↔ Fast-Paced).

Development & Rewrites:

Players can invest cash and time to improve a script's appeal or complexity.

Hiring a skilled writer allows for more effective rewrites.

Generative Descriptions: Long-term, the game could generate evocative script summaries based on genre, themes, and tone, akin to Dwarf Fortress's world generation.

3.2 Talent & Staff
The studio is nothing without its people. Talent is procedurally generated, with visible stats and hidden traits that are revealed over time.

Actors, Directors, & Writers:

Attributes: Each has stats for Skill, Fame, and Salary.

Synergy: Talent may have preferences for certain genres, themes, or collaborators.

Memory: Talent remembers past collaborations with the player's studio, affecting loyalty and future contract negotiations.

Expanded Studio Roster (Strategic Hires):

Producers: Provide passive studio-wide bonuses.

Line Producer: Reduces risk of budget overruns.

Creative Producer: Improves the quality of script pitches.

Executive Producer: Helps secure better financing and distribution deals.

"Below-the-Line" Talent: Can be hired per-film or as part of an upgraded internal department.

Cinematographer: Can boost critic_score and unlock visual style tags.

Composer: Can improve audience scores and add a small fame modifier.

Editor: Directly influences a film's pacing and can "rescue" a troubled production.

3.3 Production & Release Cycle
Timing is everything. Where and when a film is released is as important as how it's made.

Release Windows: The player strategically chooses a release month for each film.

Seasonal Trends: Genre popularity fluctuates quarterly (e.g., Action in summer, Drama in awards season). The player receives a forecast to plan ahead.

Competition: The release calendar shows films from rival studios, allowing the player to either compete directly or counter-program in an empty slot.

Holding Costs: Delaying a finished film to wait for a better window will incur monthly costs.

3.4 Finance & Market Simulation
This system models the economic realities of Hollywood, rewarding careful financial planning and market awareness.

Revenue Streams:

Box Office: Calculated based on film quality, actor fame, genre/seasonal alignment, and marketing spend, minus a competition penalty.

Distribution Deals: Instead of a simple release, players may need to negotiate deals (theatrical vs. streaming), trading a percentage of revenue for wider distribution or a guaranteed payout.

Merchandising & IP: Successful franchises can generate long-term ancillary revenue from merchandise, becoming a vital income stream.

Market Dynamics:

Rival Studios: AI-controlled studios compete for talent, scripts, and box office dominance.

Market Saturation: If too many films of the same genre are released in a short period, audience fatigue sets in, creating diminishing returns for everyone.

3.5 The Studio: Reputation & Assets
The player's studio is a character in itself, evolving based on its successes and failures.

Prestige & Reputation:

Prestige: A master score that unlocks access to higher-tier talent and scripts. Gained by releasing critically acclaimed and profitable films.

Reputation Matrix: The studio develops a distinct identity based on player choices:

Talent-Friendly ↔ Corporate Machine: Influences talent loyalty and contract costs.

Arthouse Darling ↔ Blockbuster Factory: Creates a niche, attracting specific types of scripts and directors.

Studio Upgrades: Players can invest cash to build permanent studio departments, providing passive bonuses and unlocking new strategic actions (e.g., an In-House Marketing Department unlocks viral campaigns).

4.0 Advanced & Long-Term Systems
These features are designed to create deep, long-term engagement and emergent narratives.

4.1 Talent Career Arcs & Aging
Actors and other talent are not static entities; they have entire careers that the player influences.

Aging System: Talent ages over time, affecting their fame potential and suitability for certain roles (e.g., an aging actor may be less effective in action blockbusters but perfect for prestige dramas).

Career Arcs: The system tracks an individual's career trajectory, generating labels like "Rising Star," "Washed Up," or "Cult Icon." A "Comeback Story" arc is possible for older actors who star in a hit film.

Retirement & Legacy: Talent will eventually retire or pass away, leaving a legacy. Some may transition into new roles (e.g., an actor becomes a director).

4.2 Systemic Events & Narrative
The simulation will generate challenges and opportunities that mimic the chaotic nature of Hollywood.

Scandal & PR Management: A star or the studio itself can be hit by a scandal, triggering a crisis event that requires player intervention (e.g., fire the talent, hire a PR firm, or ignore the problem and risk the consequences).

Random Events: Viral successes, unexpected PR disasters, film festival buzz, and sudden shifts in genre popularity will keep the player on their toes.

4.3 Historical Eras & Technology
The game can be set against a backdrop of evolving film history and technology.

Era Modes: Players could run a studio in a specific time period (e.g., the 1950s Studio System, with exclusive actor contracts) for a unique challenge.

Technology Tree: Players can invest R&D funds into new filmmaking technologies like Color film, CGI, or 3D. Being an early adopter is risky but can lead to massive competitive advantages.

5.0 Technical & User Interface
The interface will be clean, functional, and text-focused, with potential for future expansion.

Initial Implementation: Rich CLI formatting (e.g., using rich or textual in Python).

Desktop Version: A simple GUI could be developed using Tkinter or a more modern framework.

Data Export: All reports and high score boards should be exportable to CSV for easy analysis by the player community.

Persistence: A robust save/load system is essential for long-term play.
